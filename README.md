Isolate
=======

How iOS 8's group message DND mode was supposed to be implemented.

### How to use Isolate

* Open Settings > Isolate and enable it if it isn't already.
* Go into a group message
* Tap "Details" in the top right
* Scroll down until you see the "Do Not Disturb" option; turn this on.
* Isolate will automatically block banners, notification center alerts, and lock screen alerts for this group message.

### Compatibility
* Isolate works with iOS 8.0+ and all iDevice models
